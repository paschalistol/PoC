	Level 1: 
	"Alright, tonight's mission:
		- Get as many valuables as possible from the houses
		- Try not to get caught
		- Escape the same way you came
	The rich people are away on business, and only the guards are left. Luckily, the guards operate alone and are paid to guard one specific house only, which makes it easier for you! 
	They usually carry a spare key and are not too bright, meaning they should be fairly easy to sneak up on.

	Good luck!"

	Level 2:
	"This time, the goal is not just money; it's a stash of highly valuable documents and a taste of sweet revenge! The old man living here will get what he deserves for ruining your life. 
	He's cautious though; he has employed guards and trained attack dogs at his disposal. I'm not kidding, those dogs are no joke. Avoid detection at all costs!
	- Get the documents, most likely found in a safe inside the mansion
	- Try you best not get caught
	- Escape with style!

	Good luck!"
